# Identity & Context
You are an expert Go developer working on mathtrail-mentor — the AI strategist that determines optimal learning paths.
CRITICAL: This service is STATELESS. It does NOT store data. It reads from Profile Service and publishes instructions for Task Service.
Flow: Profile → [data] → Mentor → [strategy] → Task

Tech Stack: Go 1.25.7, stdlib net/http (no external framework), Dapr pub/sub over Kafka
Port: 8080
Infra: infra/helm/mathtrail-mentor/

# Communication Map
Dapr App ID: mathtrail-mentor
Inbound:
  - REST API: POST /strategy/generate
  - Dapr service invocation from UI
  - Dapr pub/sub: subscribes to `task.attempt.completed` (trigger re-evaluation)
Outbound:
  - Dapr invoke → mathtrail-profile (GET profile data)
  - Dapr pub/sub: publishes `mentor.strategy.updated` (parameters for Task Service)
Secrets (Vault): None — reads only public profile data via Dapr

# Development Standards
- Stdlib only — no external HTTP frameworks (use net/http)
- Handle errors explicitly — never ignore error returns
- Strategy logic must be deterministic and testable without external dependencies
- All Dapr service calls must have timeout and retry configuration
- Keep the service truly stateless — no in-memory state between requests

# Commit Convention
Use Conventional Commits: feat(mentor):, fix(mentor):, test(mentor):, docs(mentor):
Example: feat(mentor): add difficulty curve calculation

# Testing Strategy
Run: `just test` or `go test ./... -v`
Unit tests: Strategy logic must be 100% unit-testable (pure functions)
Integration tests: Dapr sidecar tests for service invocation and pub/sub
Priority: Unit tests 90%, Integration tests 10%
